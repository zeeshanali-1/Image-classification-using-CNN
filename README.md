The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 color images divided into 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. The initial step involves visualizing the first 25 images from the training set.

To build the model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed using Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers to process the image data. The network is designed to handle input images of size 32x32x3 (height, width, color channels). As the model goes deeper, the height and width of the images decrease, but the depth increases by adding more output channels.

To finalize the model, the 3D output tensor from the convolutional layers is flattened into a 1D vector, followed by adding Dense layers for classification. The final Dense layer has 10 outputs corresponding to the 10 classes in CIFAR-10.

After compiling and training the model, it achieves a test accuracy of over 70%. This demonstrates that even a simple CNN can perform effectively on image classification tasks.
